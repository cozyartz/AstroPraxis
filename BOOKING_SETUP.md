# Booking System Setup Guide

## Overview
The booking system has been successfully integrated with Square API for payment processing. Here's how to complete the setup:

## üîß Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following:

```bash
# Required Square API Configuration
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_square_access_token_here
SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_square_application_id_here
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # Change to 'production' for live

# Optional Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
```

### 2. Square API Setup
1. Create a Square Developer Account at https://developer.squareup.com/
2. Create a new application
3. Get your Application ID and Access Token
4. Update the application ID in `src/components/SquarePayment.tsx` (line 23)

### 3. Deployment Configuration
Since the booking system uses server-side API routes, you'll need to deploy using a Node.js-compatible platform:

**For Cloudflare Pages:**
- The current configuration may need adjustment for Cloudflare Workers
- Consider using Cloudflare Workers for API routes or switching to Vercel/Netlify

**For Vercel/Netlify:**
- Deploy as-is - the Node.js adapter will work out of the box
