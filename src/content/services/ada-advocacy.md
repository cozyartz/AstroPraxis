We bring deep experience in:

- WCAG and Section 508 audits  
- Inclusive UX and interface reviews  
- Accessibility roadmap planning  
- Staff training and accessibility culture building  
- Integration with civic tech and nonprofit tools  

Our work is shaped by lived experience, policy knowledge, and a commitment to equity that doesn’t stop at legal minimums. Accessibility isn’t a checklist — it’s a practice.
