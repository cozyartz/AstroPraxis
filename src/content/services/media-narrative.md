## Our Philosophy

We believe effective narrative work should be:

- **Authentic**: Rooted in real experiences and genuine values
- **Strategic**: Aligned with organizational goals and theory of change
- **Inclusive**: Centering marginalized voices and experiences
- **Sustainable**: Building long-term capacity rather than one-off campaigns
- **Accountable**: Responsive to community feedback and impact

Whether you need a complete narrative strategy overhaul or support with specific media projects, we help organizations tell their stories with integrity, impact, and intention.
