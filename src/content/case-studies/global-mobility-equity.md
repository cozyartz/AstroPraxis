## Why This Matters

International and first-generation (first-gen) professionals bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the workforce. However, they often face unique challenges when transitioning from academic environments to professional settings. These challenges can include navigating unfamiliar workplace cultures, understanding unspoken norms, and accessing mentorship opportunities.

Organizations aiming to foster inclusive and equitable workplaces must recognize and address these challenges to support the success and retention of international and first-gen employees.
