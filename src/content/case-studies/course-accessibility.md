## Why Accessibility Audits Matter

Accessibility isn’t a checklist. It’s an ethic.

When we audit our course designs through the lens of access, we’re not just fixing contrast ratios or adding captions — we’re asking: *Who is this course built for? And who is it quietly leaving out?*

An access-first audit centers the experiences of learners who are most often excluded — and creates a stronger, more adaptable learning environment for everyone.

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Developed by the W3C, WCAG offers the foundational technical standards for making web-based content more accessible. Its principles:

- **Perceivable** – Information must be visible or audible in multiple ways.
- **Operable** – All users must be able to navigate and interact.
- **Understandable** – Information and interface must be clear and predictable.
- **Robust** – Content must work with assistive technologies and different devices.

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

UDL goes beyond compliance. It’s about designing from the margins — creating flexible environments that offer *multiple pathways* for learners to engage, understand, and express.

- **Engagement** – Provide varied ways to connect with content and stay motivated.
- **Representation** – Present information in multiple formats (text, audio, visuals, etc.).
- **Action & Expression** – Offer multiple ways to demonstrate understanding.

## <i class="fas fa-check-circle text-indigo-400"></i> Steps for Conducting an Access-First Audit

### 1. Review Course Materials

- Check for plain language, consistent voice, and minimized jargon.
- Ensure all video/audio content includes accurate captions and transcripts.
- Use structured documents with headers, alt text, and semantic markup.

### 2. Evaluate Course Navigation

- Use consistent layouts across modules and pages.
- Verify that every interaction is accessible by keyboard alone.
- Provide clear breadcrumbs or visual orientation cues.

### 3. Assess Visual Design

- Use sufficient color contrast between background and text.
- Choose legible font families and sizes.
- Ensure all images, charts, and icons have meaningful alt text.

### 4. Test with Assistive Technologies

- Use screen readers like **NVDA** or **JAWS** to audit flow and hierarchy.
- Try navigating the course using only voice (Dragon, Siri) or tab keys.
- Check content responsiveness and adaptability across device types.

### 5. Gather and Act on Feedback

- Survey learners about barriers or confusion points.
- Host feedback sessions with disabled learners and access experts.
- Create an “access log” to track and prioritize iterative fixes.

## In Closing

This work isn’t about perfection — it’s about *responsiveness*.

Designing for access means asking better questions, listening deeply, and making room for more kinds of learners to feel seen, supported, and successful. And that’s not just good pedagogy. That’s justice.
