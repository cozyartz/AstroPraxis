## Why This Matters

Most onboarding processes are built for compliance — not for care.

They frontload paperwork. They bury power. They assume readiness. For folks with trauma histories, disabilities, or marginalized identities, these systems don’t just feel cold — they feel unsafe.

If the first week of work teaches someone how much masking they’ll need to survive, the system is broken.

## <i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation text-indigo-400"></i> A Typical Flow (The Problem)

- Intake forms with no context or accommodations
- Calendar invites with unclear power dynamics
- Org charts that obscure decision-makers
- Handbooks dropped with no discussion of values

*Result: confusion, self-protection, and a return to invisibility.*

## <i class="fas fa-heart text-indigo-400"></i> Our Design Principles

| Principle              | Practice                                                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consent-first**      | Don’t assume readiness. Always ask.                              |
| **Transparent power**  | Name who decides what — and how.                                 |
| **Predictable pacing** | Provide roadmaps, timelines, and pauses.                         |
| **Multiple modes**     | Let people absorb info how they learn best.                      |
| **Ongoing welcome**    | Onboarding is not a date on the calendar — it’s a design ethic.  |

## <i class="fas fa-seedling text-indigo-400"></i> A Redesigned Flow (The Alternative)

### Day 0: Welcome Letter  
A warm, purpose-driven email that introduces what’s coming — not just the logistics, but the *why* behind it all.

### Day 1: Intro Meeting  
One-on-one or small group space. Camera optional. Conversation structured around purpose, not just procedure.

### Week 1: Flexible Flow  
Meet the team asynchronously. Choose an onboarding buddy. Set your own pacing with a shared roadmap. Take a break when needed.

## <i class="fas fa-clipboard-check text-indigo-400"></i> What You Can Try Today

- Send meeting agendas in advance (and mean it)
- Rewrite docs for skimmability and tone
- Ask: “What would help you feel welcomed?”
- Assign a care point person — not just HR, but someone who checks in

## <i class="fas fa-lightbulb text-indigo-400"></i> Why This Is Systems Work

Trauma-informed design isn’t about being soft — it’s about being *structured with care*. It’s about designing systems that expect harm has happened, and work to interrupt it.

In onboarding, that means:
- Clarity instead of ambiguity
- Consent instead of assumption
- Dialogue instead of hierarchy

## In Closing

Onboarding is a first impression — but also a first contract.

It says: *This is how we care for each other here. This is what power looks like here. This is how you’ll be seen.*

**Let’s design that message with intention. [Start a conversation →](/contact)**
